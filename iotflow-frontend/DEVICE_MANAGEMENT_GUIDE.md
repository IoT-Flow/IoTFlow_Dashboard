## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
IoTFlow Dashboard
├── Overview Page
│   └── DeviceControlCard (Quick Controls)
├── Devices Page
│   ├── Device Table (with control buttons)
│   └── DeviceControlDialog (Full Control Interface)
├── WebSocket Context (Real-time communication)
├── API Service (Device commands and status)

```

### Real-time Flow
1. User initiates command via UI
2. Command sent via WebSocket for immediate feedback
3. Command also sent via API for persistence
4. Device processes command and responds
5. Real-time status update via WebSocket
6. UI updates with new device state
7. Command logged in history

### Demo Integration
- Multiple demo accounts with different device sets
- Realistic device behavior simulation
- Command execution with simulated delays
