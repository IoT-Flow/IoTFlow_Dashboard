# IoTFlow Dashboard - Authentication & User Management Guide

## üîê Authentication System

The IoTFlow Dashboard features a comprehensive authentication system that supports both email and username login, with secure password-based authentication and user-specific device management.

### üöÄ Login Options

Users can authenticate using either:
- **Email address** (e.g., `john@iotflow.com`)
- **Username** (e.g., `john`)

Both authentication methods accept the same password for each user account.
